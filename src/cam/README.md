# CAM

 **CAM**  is short for  **C**ommunication  **A**cceleration for  **M**atrix on Ascend NPU. CAM provides EP (Expert Parallelism) communication kernels, high performance KVCache transfer for PD disaggregation and KVC pooling, AFD communication kernels, RL weights transfer and so on. CAM is easily to be run in single kernel mode or integrated into vllm or SGLang framework.
